# "Movies_ETL-Analysis" Week 8 Challenge
### Tools Used
* Pandas Dataframes
* JSON
* Numpy NaN replacement
* SQLAlchemy
* Psycopg2

The goal of this project is to make a data extraction pipeline that reads metadata, performs transformations to clean and condense it, and loads the data into a SQL database. By taking code from the weekly module, we refractored it into a function to make it more streamlined than before.
